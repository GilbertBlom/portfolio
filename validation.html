     <h2>Accessibility</h2>
	  <p>  The manual testing that was executed on my website were extensive in nature. I started with the contrast testing which was simple to complete. I used a screen reader to ensure that all the content on my website was able to be read and used the keyboard controls to navigate through my website to ensure that there was keyboard accessibility. All the different test was simple and did not take up much time at all. The small amount of time that was taken to ensure my website was accessible to all users is well worth it. </p>

     <h3>Color Scheme</h3>
     <p>   The color scheme test was completed using a website called “WebAIM” that ensures that all backgrounds and foregrounds are within the recommended contrast scheme. My website started with using two different backgrounds and two different foregrounds. My original background for the body was background: linear-gradient(40deg, #3366cc, #85a3e0, #c2d1f0);, background: linear-gradient(40deg, #6699cc, #9fbfdf, #d9e6f2); and the foreground was color: #222;. With those color schemes my rating was low at 2.96:1 which was failing across all testing. I then changed my backgrounds and foreground to background: linear-gradient(40deg, #FF5CAD, #ff66b3, #ff99cc, #ffe6f2); and color: #000; which now has my ratio at 7.38:1 and passing in all aspects of the test.  </p>

     <h3>Keyboard Navigation</h3>
     <p>  The next test performed was the keyboard accessibility test to ensure that my website was able to be navigated with only using the keyboard. I started with checking that if I used only the “tab” key would I be able to navigate through my site without any issues. That test proved to be successful, so I moved on to the next phase which was using the spacebar. Using the spacebar allowed me to successfully scroll down on my webpages and using the arrow keys did too. The enter key allowed me to navigate through different pages along with the tab key and that was successful as well.</p>

     <h3>Screen Reader</h3>
     <p>  This next accessibility test I initiated was the screen reader test which I had to download some software to complete. I used a software program called NVDA screen reader, this software was free and didn’t take long to set up. After setting the software up I started testing out my website to see if everything would work as needed. The test itself worked perfectly and I was able to go through my whole website with the screen reader and it was flawless. The screen reader read every aspect of my website including the photos and all other links. With all that said my website did pass this test successfully.</p>
