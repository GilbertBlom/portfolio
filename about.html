		<h2>Hello I'm Gilbert</h2>
		<p><span>I'm currently a student at Purdue University Global online studying 
		Information Technology. I'm holding a steady G.P.A of 3.65 and have multiple facets of information. I have studied database administration using Microsoft Access as well as SQL Server Management. I also have studied Network Administration where I learned a lot about the technical aspects of Information Technology. </span></p>
		<p><span>I live in Altoona Pa. with my Fiance and daughter. I have always had a love for technology since I can remember. Growing up we had a comodore 64 that was awesome in those days. I loved learning how to take my computer apart and rebuilding it. It wasn't until I got older that I really started wanting to start developing and designing. Once I got that first taste of creating my own site it was sealed, that is what I wanted to do. </span></p>
		<p><span>I graduate June of 2020 and I am looking forward to starting a career doing what I love. I know that hard work gets results and I am not afraid of hard work. I work great in team settings but also am good on my own. I know how to ask questions and not afraid to admit when I don't know something. I don't have too many projects to date that I have finished, however, the ones I do have finished will be on my portfolio page. </span></p>
